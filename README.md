# Snake Game

This repository hosts an HTML5 implementation of the classic Snake game.

## Overview

The game runs entirely in the browser and offers a modern take on the traditional Snake formula. It includes multiple difficulty settings, a progression system through different worlds and levels, customizable skins for the snake, and optional audio effects and music.

## Opening the Game

Open `Snake Github.html` directly in your favorite web browser. You can either double-click the file on your system or drag it onto an open browser window. No additional server setup is required.

## Main Features

- **Levels and Worlds** – Progress through a series of worlds, each containing multiple levels.
- **Skins** – Change the appearance of your snake with different skins.
- **Audio** – Toggle music and sound effects, and adjust volume.

## Local Storage & Dependencies

Game settings, progress, and high scores are saved using the browser's `localStorage` API. The HTML file loads external resources from CDNs, including Tailwind CSS for styles, Google Fonts for typography, and Tone.js for audio playback.
